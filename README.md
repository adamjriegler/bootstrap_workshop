**When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
   
   I would use Bootstrap any time that I want to throw together a really nice looking website in a pretty short amount of time. I wouldn't want to use this when creating a new product or startup because it would prevent some customization options.

**What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
 
 Websites would end up looking very similar to each other because of the template style of Bootstrap.
